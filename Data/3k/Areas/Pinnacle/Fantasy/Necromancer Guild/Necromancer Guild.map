To begin the journey in becoming a minion of death, type 'begin <name>' where <name> is the name of your sponsoring reaper.

For example, if you select a year-expiring perk, and still have a month left in that same perk, the resulting perk will expire in one year.  Note: If you select perks (either individually or in a package) that result in unlimited uses, it will replace any corresponding perks that you have remaining individual uses for.  For example, if you have one remaining Spell Star Reset perk to use, selecting the Unlimited Spell Star Reset perk will clear it out.  Note: If you select a package and already have Necromancer perks active within that package, they will either be refreshed (in the case of expiring perks), replaced (in the case of unlimited perks overriding individual perks) or simply ignored (in the case of permanent perks).

R {353}{0}{<178>}{Shrine to Lyrra, the Duchess Vampire}{ }{Through ivy covered gates, you enter the secluded domain of Lyrra, the Duchess of Vampires and Domina of Night. The thick, heavy scent of burning incense assails your senses. The rough stone walls of the shrine are pitted black from smoke and sand rasps against the stone floor under your feet as you cautiously tread upon vampire territory. The shrine is dominated by an altar in the center of the room, over which stands a large stone icon of the Duchess Lyrra with her arms held outward in an eternal embrace of the night. Just beyond the altar is a stairwell that leads down into darkness. Great power emanates from within the depths of this darkness.  Those aspiring to join the ranks of Lyrra's progeny should begin by convincing a vampire of their worthiness, and then undergo the joining ceremony. To begin their initiation, candidates should type 'begin <name>', where <name> is the name of their sponsoring vampire. }{}{}{}{}{1.000}{}

It is very thick and has extremely large sturdy legs.  It is covered with different utensils and glass wear typically used in alchemy and potion making shops.  The walls are lined with several bookshelves that are barren except for a few lone cobwebs and a thin layer of dust.}{}{}{}{}{1.000}{}

Stone coffins of smokey  marble line the walls flanking the gateway, soldiers of another age  here to guard the crypt.  A lone figure stands beside the portal,  his faintly glowing eyes watching you.}{Necs}{}{}{}{1.000}{}

Having stepped from the mortal confines of the guild halls, you now look out over what appears to be rolling waves of black and white.  As large as can be imagined, and as small as can be conceived, the waves are formed from the thoughts of the gods.  Where the waves crash into one another, bright crimson can be seen.  These energies are the positive and negative material planes of existence, and as a pure necromancer, you must choose one or both.  The choice of a plane to embrace can only occur by the free will of a red necromancer.  Red, the color of neutrality, can be embraced forever, or it can be shed, in favor of black or white.  The choice is yours.  'choose' the positive or negative plane, or choose to leave this room, remaining red for yet another day.}{Necs}{}{}{}{1.000}{}
